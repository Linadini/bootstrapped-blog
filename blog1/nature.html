        <h1>Nature is a teacher</h1>
        <h4>What happens when you allow everything to be “as it is”?</h4>
        <p>
          A number of years ago I went on holiday to a beautiful part of Portugal. We stayed in a converted farmhouse in the middle of a national park.
          The farmhouse was in a valley. We arrived in the evening when the birds were just starting to roost.
          It was still warm and the air smelled sweet with pollen. You could hear the hum of crickets.
           A small river flowed through that valley. We opened a rickety gate and crossed a small wooden bridge.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we walked along the narrow path that led to our house I had a clear vision of what my morning routine would be like for the next fourteen days.
          I had been working hard for the last few months and I felt tired. I wanted this holiday to be a mini retreat.
          I would wake up early each day when it was still quite cool and I would meditate for a while. I imagined myself sitting in a peaceful spot, my mind calm, my body relaxed… listening to the river flowing, hearing the birds and wildlife starting to stir, feeling the first rays of the early morning sun hit my face as it rose over the top of the hill. Present. Even as I write this now, it sounds like paradise to me
          </p>

        <p>I work up early the next morning and it was just as I imagined it would be. There is nothing like the stillness of the early morning.
          There was a gentle, peaceful feeling that enveloped me. It didn’t come from me but seemed to come from the earth and the river and the mountains. Everything was clearer than usual. The mind wasn’t racing here and there the way it normally does.
          I had never been to this place before but it felt welcoming and familiar</p>

        <p>
           I found a spot to sit quietly. I could hear the faint hum of insects. The air was very still and there was only an occasional gentle breeze.
           A fly landed on my face. After a moment or two I carefully lifted my hand and gently ushered him away. Then another fly landed on my face. And another.
           And another. The feeling I had experienced a few moments ago was gone.
           I endured thirty minutes or so of mild torture that first morning before I admitted defeat and retreated to the farmhouse.
         </p>
         <p>
           In the ensuing days I experimented with different approaches. I went to a different spot to try and escape the flies. I went at different times of the day. I had been practicing meditation for many years already and I had dealt with all kinds of distractions and obstacles in the past. I was sure that this would be no different. I had heard lots of stories and parables about similar experiences where the “lesson” is: “Your resistance to things not being the way you want them to be is the real source of your suffering. Drop your resistance. Drop your attachment to things being a certain way”. Words. I had repeated these same words to others many times. The words made sense to me and I believed them. I said these words to myself now. I tried to feel compassion for each fly that landed on me. I tried to change my perspective. I tried to simply experience the movements of each fly as pure sensation on my skin. I reminded myself that flies are an important part of the ecosystem and tried to appreciate each fly. I was lying to myself. Things weren’t going the way I wanted them to. I really hated those flies. I just felt irritated and tense. I was in a constant state of vigilance…waiting for the next fly to land on my skin, knowing that I would have to “mindfully” endure its presence for as long as possible until finally, when I could take no more, I would choose to “mindfully” flick it away… knowing also that in a few moments it would inevitably return. I thought about abandoning my plan to practice outside in nature and moving inside to the farmhouse. I’m stubborn though and I endured several more mornings of mental torture.
